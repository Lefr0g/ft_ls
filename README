	- There are some subtle differences in behavior when comparing ls on
	OSX and Linux. This ft_ls takes this into account and tries to mimic
	the Linux behavior when compiled on such system

	- Perfect listed output layout. All columns are aligned, and spacing
	is exactly the same as ls, even for device files

	- Long output correctly shows if extended attributes '@' or extended
	security information '+' is present for each entry

	- When the output is redirected to a file, the program will turn on
	the -1 option, just as ls does

	- The default output considers the width of the terminal to fit and
	align entries. However, the sorting is done horizontally, while on ls
	the sorting is vertical

	- Source code and header are extensively commented
